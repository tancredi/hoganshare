Hoganshare
==========

A CoffeeScript utility to share Hogan pre-compiled templates across server-side and client-side.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tancredi/hoganshare.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tancredi/personal-website)

Given a directory name and an extension (optional - set as .html by default) Hoganshare will return a javascript string that declares all found templates as compiled function, saving them under `window.templates` namespace.

###Installation

``npm install hoganshare``

###Usage with Express

In this example I assign a route to the JS template generated by Hoganshare

```Javascript
HoganShare = require 'hoganshare'

hoganshare = new HoganShare("/path/to/templates");

this.get("/templates.js", function (req, res) {
    res.contentType(".js");
    res.send(hoganshare.getTemplates());
});
```

All you will have to do then is including `/templates.js` in your page to have your templates assigned to the `window.templatess` object.

Path and filename will used as index in the templates array. E.g. `partials/sidebar.html` will be saved as a function under templates['templates/partials/sidebar'].

Enjoy!
